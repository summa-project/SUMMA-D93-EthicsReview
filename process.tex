\section{SUMMA ethics process -- the Ethics Advisory Board (EAB)}
\label{sec:process}

\project will be proactive in dealing with ethical concerns. In order to comply with current best practice, we have convened an Ethics Advisory Board (EAB), which  will meet at least annually face-to-face, and virtually as required. The EAB involves representatives from each of the project partners, as well as four independent experts:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Prof Mireille Hildebrandt (Law Science Technology and Society (LSTS), Vrije Universiteit Brussels; \url{http://www.vub.ac.be/LSTS/members/hildebrandt/})
    \item Dr Els Kindt (Centre for IT \& IP Law, KU Leuven; \url{https://www.law.kuleuven.be/citip/en/staff/00016922})
    \item Dr Julia Powles (Faculty of Law and Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge; \url{http://www.law.cam.ac.uk/people/academic/j-powles/4273})
    \item Prof Lorna Woods (School of Law, University of Essex; \url{https://www.essex.ac.uk/law/staff/profile.aspx?ID=3355})
\end{itemize}

The first meeting of the EAB took place on 18 July 2016, in London. Three of the four external experts attended: Mireille Hildebrandt, Els Kindt, and Julia Powles.  The aims of this meeting were defined as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item 
To perform an initial ethics check relating to the planned research and innovation activities which will be carried out in \project;
\item 
To review the draft data management plan (D2.1), and to ensure that the procedures which will be implemented for data collection, storage, protection, retention and destruction comply with national and EU legislation;
\item 
To review proposed data import-export with non-EU countries;
\item 
To advise on a privacy impact assessment for \project;
\item 
To advise on the risks of potential dual use of \project technologies, and what actions we might take to mitigate these risks;
\item 
To discuss broader ethical concerns arising from the \project project.
\end{itemize}
Finally, the initial EAB also discussed the ethics process within \project.

 The independent report of the external experts, following the initial EAB meeting will be attached to this report as an appendix when it is available.
